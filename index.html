<p>As a front-end technical writer, I learned to see things from the user's perspective. I learned the importance of clarity and concision in communication. As an API docs writer, I developed my technical side. Working in startups, I gained experience supporting clients through advanced challenges and highly technical problems. I also supported marketing and sales and gained experience mentoring team members. I gained experience as product owner for two different products, so I know how software is developed and what developers need to work with. My M.O. has always been to build consensus, to clarify, and to collaborate.</p>

<p>Now, I am bringing this experience with me as I transititon to product management.</p>
