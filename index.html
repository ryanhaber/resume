<h1>I make things clear.</h1>

<p>I help shape, document, market, and support APIs and other technical products. My goal is to showcase APIs, promote their adoption, and channel market feedback into the development process.</p>

<p>Between college and technical writing, I worked as a youth minister and then attended seminary at Mt St Mary&rsquo;s University. I started a second career, this time as a technical writer, after leaving the seminary. My technical writing career started over a jelly doughnut. Ask me about that. <a href="http://api-ambassador.ghost.io/i-never-meant-to-be-a-technical-writer/" target="_blank">Or read about it.</a></p>

<p>My first job technical writing was to document the user experience of video monitoring software. I reshaped the company&rsquo;s rudimentary, UI-based docs to focus on users and their tasks. Then I applied my experience with computer science to document APIs at MicroStrategy. At Perfect Sense, I documented SOPs, development tools, and Java class libraries.</p>

<p>My freelance projects have included: editing docs, setting up single-source solutions, preparing docs for translation, and building web helps and CMS-based websites. I used this experience to build Zoomdata&rsquo;s developer docs and developer outreach from the ground up. I supported sales, marketing, and customer support with tier-2 knowledge of our APIs. I built our developer zone and managed the migration of our docs portal from a cloud solution to one that we developed and hosted ourselves.</p>

<p>Now I work at Blackboard as API Ambassador and Sr Content Designer. I help developers use Blackboard APIs by:</p>
<ul><li>Writing technical help for them</li>
	<li>Meeting with them in person and online</li>
	<li>Helping run a community of practice for them</li>
</ul>
<p>I help Blackboard by:</p>
<ul><li>Helping customers to navigate the in's and out's of our APIs</li>
	<li>Bringing developer feedback back to Blackboard</li>
	<li>Sharing technical within Blackboard</li>
</ul>
